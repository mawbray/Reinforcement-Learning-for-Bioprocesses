# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Bioprocesses
A study of reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous bioprocessesing

The following repository examines the implementation of various reinforcement learning algorithms (model-free) for online optimisation of continuous bioprocessing. The initial case study considers a simple fermenation model with reward allocated via backallocation from the terminal state and the associated satisfaction of some objective function.

The study considers:

 - Monte Carlo Learning 
 - SARSA
 - Q Learning
 
It explores the importance of temporal credit assignment in a discrete environment, the efficacy of multiple agent reinforcement learning  (MARL), different MIMO, MISO and SIMO arrangements as well as looking towards continuous time operation.
